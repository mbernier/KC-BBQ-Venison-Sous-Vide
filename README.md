Kansas City Barbecue Venison Sous Vide Recipe

## Ingredients
### Sauce

* 5 tablespoons butter
* 1/2 medium onion, finely chopped
* 4 finely chopped garlic cloves
* 2 cups tomato sauce or ketchup
* 1/2 cup apple juice
* 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 3 tablespoons paprika
* 2 tablespoons chili powder
* Salt to taste
* Cayenne to taste

### The Rest 

* 2-3 lb Big venison Loin
* 1/2 cup of vegetable oil

## Directions

1. Heat up your Sous Vide oven to 131Â° F. 
1. Cook the grated onion in the butter over medium heat until soft, but not browned. 
1. Add the garlic and cook another minute or two.
1. Add the remaining sauce ingredients, bring to a simmer and cook gently for 15 minutes. 
1. Seperate 1/3 of your sauce for use later.
1. With the remaining 2/3 of your sauce, mix in the 1/2 cup of vegetable oil.
1. Put both of your sauces in the fridge to cool.
1. Place the Venison loin in a ziploc bag or vaccuum seal bag.
1. Pour the sauce with the oil into the bag with the venison.
1. Seal it (Note: your vaccuum sealer may have a moist setting, if not just use the water displacement method for getting the air out of your ziploc bag).
1. Place the bag in the sous vide oven and walk away for 12 hours. 
1. When the time is up, slice or pull apart the meat and serve.
